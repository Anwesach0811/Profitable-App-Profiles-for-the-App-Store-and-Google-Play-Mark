    "We only build apps that are free to download and install, and our main source of revenue consists of in-app ads. This means that our revenue for any given app is mostly influenced by the number of users that use our app. Our goal for this project is to analyze data to help our developers understand what kinds of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",

    "# Goal for making a Profitable App\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned in the introduction, our aim is to determine the kinds of apps that are likely to attract more users because our revenue is highly influenced by the number of people using our apps.\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize risks and overhead, our validation strategy for an app idea is comprised of three steps:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li>Build a minimal Android version of the app, and add it to Google Play. </li>\n",
    "<li>If the app has a good response from users, we then develop it further. </li>\n",
    "<li>If the app is profitable after six months, we also build an iOS version of the app and add it to the App Store. </li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because our end goal is to add the app on both the App Store and Google Play, we need to find app profiles that are successful on both markets. For instance, a profile that might work well for both markets might be a productivity app that makes use of gamification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's begin the analysis by getting a sense of the most common genres for each market. For this, we'll build a frequency table for the prime_genre column of the App Store data set, and the Genres and Category columns of the Google Play data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Motive\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll build two functions we can use to analyze the frequency tables:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>One function to generate frequency tables that show percentages</li>\n",
    "<li>Another function that we can use to display the percentages in a descending order</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n"
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "### Note\n",
    "We already learned to generate frequency tables that show percentages, and we're going to build a function for that in the exercise below. However, dictionaries don't have order, and it will be very difficult to analyze the frequency tables. We'll need to build a second function which can help us display the entries in the frequency table in a descending order.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do that, we'll need to make use of the built-in sorted() function. This function takes in an iterable data type (like a list, dictionary, tuple, etc.), and returns a list of the elements of that iterable sorted in ascending or descending order (the reverse parameter controls whether the order is ascending or descending).\n",
    "The sorted() function doesn't work too well with dictionaries because it only considers and returns the dictionary keys.\n",
    "However, the sorted() function works well if we transform the dictionary into a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a dictionary key along with its corresponding dictionary value. To ensure the sorting works right, the dictionary value comes first, and the dictionary key comes second:\n",
    "\n",
    "The display_table() function you see below:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>Takes in two parameters: dataset and index. dataset is expected to be a list of lists, and index is expected to be an integer.</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>Generates a frequency table using the freq_table() function (which you're going to write as an exercise).</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>Transforms the frequency table into a list of tuples, then sorts the list in a descending order.</ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ul>Prints the entries of the frequency table in descending order.</ul>\n",
    "\n",

    "This niche seems to be dominated by software for processing and reading ebooks, as well as various collections of libraries and dictionaries, so it's probably not a good idea to build similar apps since there'll be some significant competition.\n",
    "We concluded that taking a popular book (perhaps a more recent book) and turning it into an app could be profitable for both the Google Play and the App Store markets. The markets are already full of libraries, so we need to add some special features besides the raw version of the book. This might include daily quotes from the book, an audio version of the book, quizzes on the book, a forum where people can discuss the book, etc."
